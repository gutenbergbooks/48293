<p class='pindent'>THIS little book aspires, neither to the
utility of a guide-book, nor to the
dignity of a history. It is designed rather
as a reminder of the great events which
have given to the old city of Quebec a
world-wide fame; and with this object in
view, many of the illustrations have been
copied from old prints and drawings. With
the exception of a photograph of his painting
of Wolfe, kindly lent by J. W. L. Forster,
Esq., and the two photographs on page 57,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
taken by James Ritchie, Esq., of Quebec, the
remainder of the illustrations are largely
the result of a pleasant summer in that
quaintest part of the Dominion—once the
heart of “New France”—where picturesque
old-world customs still linger amongst
the modern fashions of this practical century.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HE figure of the
founder of Quebec
rises in history,
strong and effective,
above an ever-changing
environment
of turmoil
and unrest and
strife, as to-day
his great statue
stands in motionless dignity above the
shifting crowds of pleasure-seekers and
tourists who flit about “the Terrace” at
Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take him when you will; tossing in a
cockleshell on the mountainous rollers of
the Atlantic; testing the soil of some newly
discovered region with his grain and garden-seeds;
taking careful inventory of the products
of woods and earth and waters;
training his refractory red allies to some
method in their military madness; fighting
the loathsome death-dealing scurvy; surrounded
by disheartened or treacherous
followers; even cheated and befooled by
a frivolous notoriety-hunter—Samuel de
Champlain shows himself ever calm, cheerful,
heroic—a man of rare sincerity and
singleness of purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not much is known of the ancestry of
this truly noble
Frenchman, beyond
the names
of his father and
mother—Antoine
Champlain
and Marguerite
Le Roy. Yet we
can guess that
from his paternal
ancestry at
least he inherited
a good portion
of courage
and simplicity,
for Antoine and his brother, the more
notable “Provençal Captain,” belonged to
the race of sea-faring men, who always and
everywhere seem to be plain, bold, simple
folk. The circumstances of his early life,
moreover, tended to form the character of
the future founder of New France on firm,
strong lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samuel de Champlain was born in 1570,
or possibly a year or two earlier, at
Brouage, then a busy little seaport on the
Bay of Biscay—now a mouldering hamlet,
nearly two miles
inland, for the
ocean has retreated,
and the
business of the
place has ebbed
away with the
receding tides.
A monument,
neither very
ancient nor very
imposing, has
been erected
near the little
church, to keep
green in his birth-place the memory of the
founder of Quebec; but, according to the
account of a recent visitor, the tumble-down
cottages, sleepy street, and crumbling old
walls can give no idea of what Brouage was
in its palmy days. “The best seaport in
France,” wrote one enthusiast, about the
time Champlain was born. “Here you hear
every known language spoken!” said another,
thirty years later; and the lad
drank in from the talk of these sailors of
many tongues and nations that love of
“navigation,” which, he says, “has powerfully
attracted me ever since my boyhood,
and has led me on to expose myself almost
all my life to the impetuous buffetings of
the sea.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of this love of things nautical, in
spite of the example of the sea-captains who
frequented his home, Samuel de Champlain
was to gain experience of the ways both of
camps and courts before he took up his real
life-work as explorer and colonist. He was
born in a time of conflict. In his youth
Spain and England were at death-grips for
the dominion of the seas; and his own
country was torn by religious wars. During
his boyhood, indeed, his own little town
was twice taken in the struggle between
Huguenots and Catholics; and, when he
reached manhood, Champlain (though a
Catholic) enlisted under the banner of the
(then) Protestant king, Henry of Navarre.
It is probable that he fought in the battles
of Arques and
Ivry; it is certain,
at any rate, that
he served his king
well, and won the
favor of his superiors,
perhaps even
of the monarch
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the young
man had led a
soldier’s life for
some nine years,
the war ended
with the triumph
of Henry, and Champlain turned once
more to the sea. But he did not follow
in his father’s footsteps and take command
of a fishing-boat or a coasting
vessel. The “Provençal Captain” had
been engaged to act as pilot-general for the
transports bearing home some Spanish
troops from France, and his nephew went
with him to Cadiz, thus, for the first time,
visiting a foreign city. Things so fell out,
however, that he saw many other strange
places before returning to his native land.
The “St. Julian,” on which he had embarked,
being “a strong vessel and a good
sailer,” of no less than five hundred tons’
burden, was chosen to make one of a flotilla
destined for the West Indies, but the “Provençal
Captain” was
engaged with other
matters, and Samuel
de Champlain was
therefore invited to
take command of the
ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it happened
that in January, 1599, Champlain set forth
into that wonderful New World, of which
he had heard so much, upon which he was
to set so deep a mark. On this first voyage,
however, he did not reach the scene of his
labors in the forest-covered north. He
sailed amongst the West Indian Islands;
he visited Mexico; he made friends with
savage chiefs; he wrote vivid descriptions
of people, places and customs; he drew pictures
of beasts, birds and reptiles in a
fashion which (witness his
“two-legged chameleon”)
must have been the wonder
and despair of many a succeeding
naturalist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning home at length
with this richly illustrated
journal in his hand, Champlain
went to court, became a pensioner of
the king, and probably “a lion” in the brilliant
society of the French capital. The life
was not to his taste, but from the court a
way opened for his return to his beloved
wildernesses. An
old general of
his, De Chastes,
dreaming of the
founding of a
New France in
North America,
turned to the enthusiastic
explorer
to translate
dreams into facts;
and early in 1603 Champlain was sent with
Pont Gravé, a rugged old sea-captain of
Jacques Cartier’s home-port, St. Malo, to
take up again Cartier’s task
and explore the St. Lawrence.
The pair went as far as Hochelaga,
or “Mont Royale,” and
tried in vain to force a way
up the rapids. Champlain
then sailed for home full of
enthusiasm for the planting
of a colony on the
great river. But—“l’homme
propose
et Dieu dispose.”
Aymar de Chastes
was dead, and though
the enterprise soon
found a new patron
in the Sieur de
Monts, that nobleman
desired to make
the experimental settlement,
not on the “Great River of Hochelaga,”
but on the Acadian coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Champlain and his comrades loyally did
their utmost to make a success of each of
the unfortunate Acadian settlements in turn,
but the leaders’ lack of experience and the
intrigues of their enemies in France brought
the colony to ruin. In this hard school,
however, Champlain was learning invaluable
lessons in the art of colonization.
At times, perhaps, he thought his added
wisdom dearly bought by the miseries
of desolate St. Croix, but surely his
memory of Port Royal must have been
shot through with many a bright
thread; and often, in after years, his
eyes must have danced with laughter
when he recalled the oddities of the
sagamore, Membertou, the gay whimsicalities
of some of his associate gentlemen-pioneers,
and the joyous feasts and
good fellowship of his own famous “Ordre
de Bon Temps.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/n.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='N'/>EARLY five years
had passed since
Champlain’s former
visit to the St. Lawrence,
when, on the
third day of July,
1608, he again
landed beneath the
Rock of Quebec. He
was now in the
prime of life: strong,
resourceful, energetic; and this was the
great moment in his history, to which all
his previous experiences had been a lead
up to, from which his future life would date
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come simply, unostentatiously
(half-unconscious of the significance of
what he was doing, yet full of a steadfast
purpose which lent dignity to the trivial
details and humble beginnings of that day)
to lay the foundation of Quebec, of New
France, of the Dominion of Canada! He
was inspired by patriotism, loyalty, devotion
to the Cross, and an eager thirst for knowledge;
and in his heart there was no room
for that cursed love of gain which has sullied
the glory of so many daring explorers
of this western continent.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This time Champlain had come to Quebec
to stay, and though his first “habitation”
has long vanished from sight, the city then
begun has had the quality of permanence.
The Rock seemed a fortress ready made;
but Champlain set up his log dwellings and
store-houses nearly on the spot which is now
the Market-place of the Lower Town. The
ground covered to-day with tortuous streets
of quaint-roofed houses was then thick with
“nut-trees,” and the little company of thirty
men (there were others left trading at
Tadousac) had much ado to clear the soil.
Some wearied of their toil, and planned to
end it by the treacherous
murder of their leader;
but the plot was betrayed,
and Champlain
and his little colony were
saved from the destruction
threatening both
alike.</p>

<p class='caption'>Wigwams.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>That busy summer
ended, Pont Gravé sailed
away, leaving Champlain
and twenty-eight men to
make good during the
winter their bold invasion
of the wilderness.
They stood on the defensive;
but the neighboring
Indians proved
friendly, and no human
enemy came near their
“habitation.” Yet the foundations of New
France (as it seems of every colony) were
laid in woe and anguish. The winter had
hardly begun in earnest when the horrible
scurvy appeared amongst them, and before
spring twenty of the company lay cold and
silent beneath the snow. Of the remaining
eight, four had been at death’s door, but
Champlain himself was still full of health
and life and courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, when on an excursion up the St.
Charles, he had chanced upon a tumble-down
stone chimney, a few rusted cannon-balls,
and some other relics which convinced
him that he stood upon the spot
where Jacques Cartier had wintered
seventy-three years before. A less resolute
man might have found the discovery disheartening;
but Champlain had no thought
of retreat.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Often during that melancholy winter he
questioned the Algonquins, who had camped
beside the little fort, as to what lay in the
unknown regions beyond; and, listening to
their talk of rivers, lakes and boundless
forests, he grew more and more eager to
plunge into the wilderness. But always
the Indians added tragic stories of a foe
infesting the woodland paths and lying
ambushed beside the streams;
and so Champlain, moved
partly perhaps by chivalrous
pity for their terror, and
trusting in the superior military
skill and excellent weapons of his own
people, promised to take the field during
the coming spring against the ubiquitous
and blood-thirsty Iroquois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some writers regard this promise as the
grand mistake of Champlain’s policy.
Possibly, however, the struggle was inevitable.
At any
rate, the first anniversary
of the
founding of Quebec
had hardly
passed, when was
inaugurated the
fearful blood-feud
between the French
and the Iroquois
that for the greater
part of a century
brought out the
best and the worst of New France—courage,
steadfastness, unselfish heroism on the
one hand, and, on the other, dare-devil
recklessness and pitiless
brutality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blamable or unblamable,
Champlain and two of his
followers, clad in “helmet,
breastplate, and
greaves,” and
carrying ponderous
arquebuses,
joined a host of
painted warriors,
and caused for
once a horrible
panic in the ranks
of the Iroquois.
What brave could
stand against an
adversary who
had the thunder
and lightning at
his command?
But the Iroquois
were no cowards. Their panic passed with
the novelty of the French mode of fighting;
but their thirst for vengeance long outlived
him who had awakened it, and again and
again it threatened the very existence of
New France.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly, however, it was not the fault of
Champlain that the colony remained so
perilously feeble. He was as truly the servant
as the governor of his settlement, and
for nearly thirty years his voyages and
journeys and battles, his struggles with
mercenary traders and heedless officials,
had little intermission. He was, moreover, a
homeless man; for, though he married in
1610, his wife was a child of twelve, and he
did not bring her out to his ruinous “habitation”
for ten long years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after his return with her, he
began to build on the edge of the cliff,
where now stands the Chateau Frontenac,
a fort which, altered or rebuilt by his successors,
was afterwards known as the
Chateau St. Louis. Beneath the planks of
Dufferin Terrace its cellars still remain.
The main building was destroyed by fire in
1834; but a wing added by General Haldimand
in 1784 was only demolished in 1891
to make way for
the luxurious
Chateau Frontenac
hotel. This
often shelters ten
times the number
of people
which made up
the population
of New France
when Champlain
began the building of his
“chateau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that date six white children

<p class='pindent'>In this charitable pursuit she
enjoyed the entire approbation
of her soldier-husband,
who was reported to have
said that “the salvation of a
single soul was worth more
than the conquest of an empire,
and that kings should
extend their domains in
heathen countries only to
subject them to Christ.” In
1615 he had brought from
France several Recollet missionaries,
who, in their efforts
to win the Indian tribes for
Christ and for the Church,
showed a sublime contempt
for discomfort, hardship and
danger. They were followed, ten
years later, by a little party of
Jesuits, eager for martyrdom;
but while Champlain lived they
did not attain that painful
eminence of devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed, however, that, as
the shadows of eventide deepened
about the gallant old Governor
of Quebec, his task grew
ever harder. The twentieth year
of his settlement was just completed when
a crushing blow fell. War broke out between
France and England, and a hostile
fleet bore down upon neglected Quebec,
capturing on the way a fleet from France,
and destroying the stock and buildings of
a little farm at Cap Tourmente
from which Champlain
had hoped great things. For
weeks before this the little
garrison had been on short
rations, but Champlain from
his rock flung defiance at the
invaders, and the English
admiral retreated, leaving
his proud opponent to the
mercy of a grimmer foe. The Frenchmen
fought off starvation during the long winter
by digging up roots and casting themselves
on the charity of the Indians, but
when Kirke returned with the warm
weather, even Champlain was fain to surrender.</p>

<p class='caption'>Basilica.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In that hour his life must have seemed a
very tragedy of failure—himself a prisoner,
Quebec in the hands of the enemy, his life-work
crumbling to ruins! But in Champlain’s
vocabulary there was no such word
as despair. Immediately he set himself to
obtain the restoration of Quebec, and his
enthusiasm prevailed over all obstacles. By
the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye Quebec
was given back to France, and in 1633,
after nearly four years’ absence, Champlain
returned to his adopted country.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He received a joyous welcome from the
few French families who had remained in
the colony. The Indians, who came down
the river by hundreds in their canoes, gave
him a still more enthusiastic greeting.
Never before had there been at Quebec such
feasting, such speech-making, such a smoking
of peace-pipes; and Champlain, knowing
that the very life of the colony was bound
up with the fur-trade, cherished high hopes
for the prosperity of Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What matter that the original settlement
below the cliff lay in ruins? The Governor
immediately set about its rebuilding, and
on the Rock he erected the first parish
church of Quebec,
“Notre Dame
de Recouvrance.”
Authorities differ
as to whether it
stood on the site
of the Basilica,
or on that of the
English Cathedral,
for on a windy day in June, 1640, it
was burnt to the ground, with all it contained.
Before that catastrophe occurred
the heroic founder of Quebec had gone to
his rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his last busy years Champlain
found much time for devotional exercises,
and already in his life-time Quebec had
taken on that markedly religious character
which it bears to-day. Then, as now, black-gowned
priests pervaded the streets, and
the clear sound of the church-bells broke in
at oft-recurring intervals on the harsher
clangor of secular life. “Fort St. Louis,”
wrote the Governor’s Jesuit confessor,
“seemed like a well-managed school; in
the morning at table M. de Champlain
heard read aloud some good history, and
at night the lives of the saints; in the
evening there was private meditation, and
then prayers were said kneeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet to the end Champlain bore the
temporal welfare of his colony upon his
heart. In the last
of his letters, he
gave to Cardinal
Richelieu a glowing
account of
the possibilities
of Canada, and
begged for one
hundred and
twenty men to
subdue the Iroquois, “Then worship and
trade would increase beyond belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months later the Father of New
France was stricken with paralysis, and
on Christmas Day, 1635, he died. Amidst
the mourning of his people, he was buried
in a “sepulchre particulier,” and the
“Chapelle de Champlain” was built over
his tomb. It stood, it is believed, close beside
“Fort St. Louis,” and was therefore
very near the site of the monument erected
a few years ago to commemorate the name
and deeds of the brave, simple-hearted
founder of Quebec.</p>

the story of Quebec
takes a more
sombre hue. Its
pages tell of long-continued
warfare
with the savages;
of a fierce though
intermittent struggle
with the “heretic”
English, the
papist-hating “Bostonnais.” The tale has
no lack of heroes and of heroines, courageous,
saintly, inspired by visions of the
invisible, or driven to the supreme heights
of self-sacrifice by the most awful sights
ever shown to mortal eyes.</p>

he lorded it over the straggling settlements
along the river that then made up New

forest, and he made a
brave fight to impose
it also on the spiritual
leaders of New France,
and on the Intendant,
sent out specially to
check and thwart him.
His very faults served
New France well in that
time of agony, when the
savages were ever at her
throat, sucking away her
life-blood and mangling
her all but to dissolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In contrast to timorous La Barre and
vacillating Denonville, there is something
fascinating about the stalwart Frontenac,
who was as surely the saviour of New
France as the nobler, gentler Champlain
was its founder and father. A soldier and
a courtier, Frontenac had left his youth far
behind him, when, in 1672, he landed for
the first time at Quebec; but he could adapt
himself to circumstances, at least to any
circumstances in which his imperious will
could have free play. He was quickly at
home in the little town on the St. Lawrence,
“the future capital,” as he saw it, “of a
great empire.” He was at home also in the
camps and councils
of the redmen, stooping,
as a smaller man
would not have dared
to do, to the level of
forest manners and
forest eloquence.</p>

<p class='caption'>Blockhouse.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>During ten unquiet years he learned better
and better how to deal with the savages,
and was then called back to France, just
as the Iroquois were preparing to make a
fresh attack on Canada. The Iroquois had
no lack of prey, for by this time pioneers
and traders had scattered themselves far
and wide through the wilderness. They
did not, however, fall
unresisting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dangers of the
time had bred stern, relentless
men, and women
and children, too, ready,
like the little heroine of
Verchères, to fight to the
death for home and dear
ones. Each village had
its loop-holed blockhouse
or strong stone mill, but
the log-cabins frequently stood far from
these places of refuge, and the Iroquois
dealt in night-attacks and sudden surprises.
Whilst Denonville was governor there was
a veritable reign of terror in New France,
culminating, in August, 1689, in the frightful
massacre of Lachine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frontenac, already on his way back to
Quebec, was not the man to let the outrage
pass unavenged. Unable to deal a telling
blow at the shifting Iroquois, he struck
savagely at the white foe, whom he suspected
of encouraging the red braves in their
barbarous warfare. From Quebec, Three
Rivers and Montreal, he sent out parties of
bush-rangers and “Christian Indians” to
carry fire and sword
through the border settlements
of New England.
In the depth of
winter the cruel task
was duly accomplished,
and loud were the plaudits
of the savage allies
of the French, whose
friendship had wavered
in the hour of their discomfiture.
Speedily hundreds
of canoes, deep-laden with furs, came
down to Montreal, but the English colonists,
thirsting for revenge, seized Port Royal, in
Acadia, and then sent an expedition to
attack Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At its head was Sir William Phips, a
bold, rough seaman, who had won knighthood
by the recovery of the cargo of a long-sunk
Spanish treasure-ship;
but he soon
proved himself no
match for the old
lion Frontenac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great French
war-chief was at Montreal, feasting his
Indian admirers on dog’s flesh and prunes,
and leading them in the war-dance, when
news reached him that Phips was in the
river. Hastening down-stream in a birch-bark
canoe, he reached his little capital
long before the foe appeared. As he landed
and strode up Mountain Hill, the people
cheered him madly. Their delight was
scarcely less when the Bishop, who had been
visiting some outlying parishes, entered
the city one night by torchlight. Whilst
Frontenac looked
to his defences,
gathered fighting
men into the fortress,
and called
out the “habitants”
of Beauport and
Beaupré to defend
the shores,
the Bishop urged
his followers to do their
part, and day and night
prayers went up to all
the saints in heaven to
keep watch and ward
over Quebec.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At last, early on an
October morning, the
English fleet sailed into
the Basin, and Phips
sent a messenger to demand
the surrender of the city. But his
envoy was treated with scant courtesy.
Dragged blindfold over obstructions and
up the steep streets, while jeering women
mocked him with cries of “Colin Maillard!”
he was guided at last into a spacious hall
of the Chateau St. Louis. Here were
assembled Frontenac
and his officers
in all the glory of
plumes and ribbons,
gold lace and
powdered curls;
and when the bandage
was snatched
from his eyes the
Englishman might
well have been dazzled by their
glittering finery. But he confronted
the stern old Governor
calmly, and, laying his watch
on the table, demanded an
answer to Phips’ summons
within an hour.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frontenac was enraged by
the effrontery of the demand.
“I will answer your general
only by the mouths of my cannon,”
he replied, and the messenger,
blindfolded again, was
led off to make sport once more,
on his roundabout way to his
boat, for the shrill-voiced,
laughing French women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same night there was
another burst of merry-making
in the city. The sound of
drums, trumpets and joyous
huzzas was loud enough to reach the ears
of the English on the river. “You have
lost the game,” declared a prisoner, with
malicious delight. “It is the Governor of
Montreal with the people from the country
above. There is nothing for you now but
to pack up and go home.” But Phips was
not yet ready to take this advice.</p>

<div class='figright'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Landing a portion of his force at Beauport,
he moved his ships into position to
bombard the town. Then Frontenac from
the rock sent him his promised answer, and
for hours the cannon roared and the smoke
and din were horrible. Phips ploughed up
the gardens of the Ursulines, shot away
a corner of a nun’s apron, and wasted
his ammunition
against the
rock, but made
no impression
whatever on the
strong stone
walls of Quebec.
His enemies,
laughing
to scorn his
futile efforts,
riddled his vessels
with their
balls and shot
away from his
masthead the
proud banner
of St. George,
which was
brought ashore
in triumph in a birch-bark canoe. At last
Phips drew off from the contest, and patching
up his sorely misused ships as best he
could, dropped down the river. He was still
pursued by ill-luck and misfortune. The
annual supply ships for New France
escaped him by hiding in the fogs that overhung
the mouth of the grim Saguenay,
while fever and smallpox, hurricane and
shipwreck seemed to mark out his own fleet
as under the wrath of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Quebec all was joy and thanksgiving.
The captured flag was carried in
triumph to the Cathedral. “The Bishop
sang a Te Deum, and amid the firing of
cannon the image of the Virgin was carried
to each church and chapel in the place
by a procession in which priests, people and
troops all took part.” At night there was a
great bonfire in honor
of the redoubtable old
Governor, but the defeat
of the English was
generally regarded as
miraculous, and it was
therefore ordained that
the fête of “Notre
Dame de la Victoires”
should be celebrated
annually in the little
church of the Lower
Town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some twenty years
later, in the summer of
1711, the people of
Quebec again had
cause to rejoice in a
great deliverance. A
mighty English armament,
out-numbering by more than three
times those who could be gathered to defend
the city, was in the St. Lawrence, when a
great storm arose, dashing to pieces eight
or ten vessels on the rocks of the Egg
Islands and drowning nine hundred men.
Upon this the incompetent leaders of the
expedition, Hill and Walker, turned homeward
in dismay. Again Te Deums resounded
in Quebec, and in memory of this
second notable deliverance the little church
was called “Notre Dame des Victoires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly half a century later, the building
was sorely damaged by the English guns, but
its upper portions were afterwards rebuilt
“on the old walls,” and to-day in its quiet
little nook, just aside from the bustle of
Champlain Market, it still stands a quaint
memorial of those ancient victories and of
a world now passed away.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/p.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='P'/>HIPS’ siege of Quebec,
with its awkward
ship’s carpenter
turned admiral,
its Indian-mimicking
French Governor,
its noisy, ineffective
bombardment,
has more than
a touch of comedy;
but the drama in
which Montcalm and Wolfe dispute the
role of hero and contend for a prize of a
value guessed at only by the statesmen seers
of the time, never sinks beneath the dignity
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both the combatants were valiant, honorable,
high-minded, and lovable. Both had
already won laurels in battle. Each moved
forward to the grand catastrophe by a path
beset with difficulty and danger. Each
gave his life for his cause and his country,
and together they will live forever in the
memory of the two peoples whom their
great fight on the Plains of Abraham made
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Montcalm, like
Wolfe, had been a
soldier from boyhood,
gaining a varied experience
in the European
wars. Again in
this resembling his
rival, he was no mere
soldier delighting in
nothing but the clash
of swords. He had some love of learning
and taste for literature, and a heart that
was very tender towards home and friends.
Richer than Wolfe in one respect, he had a
well-beloved wife and children, besides the
mother to whom he wrote much the same
kind of letters as the English hero sent to
his mother at Greenwich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Montcalm, nearly fifteen years older than
his future antagonist, received his baptism
of fire almost before Wolfe was out of his
cradle. His experience of American warfare
began two full years before his rival made
his first painful passage of the Atlantic,
and, on the July day when the young English
brigadier was throwing up the redoubts
which were to silence the batteries of
Louisbourg, Montcalm, at Ticonderoga,
hundreds of miles away, was flinging back
from his bristling abatis of tree-tops a
British force nearly four times the strength
of his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men received their meed of honor
and promotion. Whilst Montcalm was
informed that “the king trusted everything
to his zeal and generalship,” Wolfe was
given a new opportunity to win distinction
in the command of an expedition against
Quebec.</p>

<p class='caption'>Wharf at Isle of Orleans.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his brief winter’s sojourn in his
native land, Wolfe had spent some weeks at
Bath, trying to recuperate his shattered
health, and in that fashionable resort of
invalids and hypochondriacs had made the
acquaintance of a beautiful girl, Katherine
Lowther, who soon consented to betroth
herself to the gaunt, odd-looking young hero
of Louisbourg.</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illo-36.jpg' alt='' id='illo-36' style='width:200px;height:300px;'/>
<p class='caption'>General Montcalm.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Montcalm, meanwhile, though a great
man in the gay little society of Quebec, was
passing his time unpleasantly
enough. Far from
home, tortured by anxiety,
and hampered by the
jealousy of the Governor
de Vaudreuil and the
shameless corruption of
the Intendant Bigot and
his accomplices, the general
declared that only a
miracle could save the
colony. The people, who
had been cheated, robbed,
and oppressed for years,
were at the point of
starvation, and were losing
heart. Yet, when
news came in May that
Wolfe had sailed to attack
Quebec, seigneurs and habitants alike
rallied bravely to the call of their leaders,
and men and boys, red warriors and white,
came pouring into the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the army of defence numbered
16,000 men, most of whom Montcalm posted
in a long-extended camp, on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence, touching the St.
Charles on the right and the Montmorency
on the left. Taking up
his quarters at Beauport,
he set his men to erect
batteries and throw up
earthworks on the steep
ridge that runs for miles
along the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the city itself—its
fortifications were garrisoned
by between one
and two thousand men,
guns were mounted on the
walls, and the gates were
shut and barricaded, except
Palace Gate, from
which a road led to the
camp at Beauport across
a bridge of boats girdling
the St. Charles. That
river was defended by a great boom of logs,
whilst floating batteries, gunboats, and fire-ships
were prepared for the protection of
the harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then when all was done came a lull of
horrible suspense, and the impatient
“habitants” grew weary of waiting behind
the entrenchments. But some, with
hopeful memories of “Notre Dame des
Victoires” and the miracles of their
grandsires’ days, pleased themselves with
the fancy that wind and wave
must again be doing their grim
work on the foe.</p>

<p class='caption'>General Wolfe.<br/> <span style='font-size:x-small'>From a painting by J. W. L. Forster.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Not so. The English fleet, of
twenty-two ships of the line and
a great number of smaller vessels,
was close at hand. It was
under the command of the gallant
Admiral Saunders, without whose
cordial co-operation Wolfe could never have
conquered Quebec, and it had on board
nearly nine thousand seasoned troops, in
addition to the seamen.</p>

<p class='caption'>Here died Wolfe<br/> victorious.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>With the unwilling aid of French pilots,
entrapped by stratagem, the vessels passed
the perilous “traverse” at Cap Tourmente,
and from that time the citizens of Quebec
had no lack of excitement. The landing of
the British on the Island of Orleans, the
abortive attempt of the French to destroy
the enemy’s fleet with their fire-ships, the
erection of English batteries on Point
Lévis and on the island, the encampment
of the British below the Falls of Montmorency,
the beginning of the bombardment,
the passing of the invaders’ ships
above the batteries of the city, all this
kept the people of Quebec in a state of
feverish expectancy. But Montcalm
was not to be tempted nor
provoked to descend for one
moment from his inaccessible
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Wolfe tried to force
a battle. He landed a body
of troops on a little beach about
a mile above the Falls, and prepared to
attack the French in their camp. But the
men first on shore were too eager. Without
waiting for orders or for their comrades,
who were crossing to their assistance by a
ford below the Falls, they tried to rush the
heights where Montcalm’s
army was
gathered in force,
and were beaten back
with heavy loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For weeks after
this battle there was
a grim game of patience between the two
skilled leaders. Unmoved by reverses on
Lake Champlain which obliged him to send
troops to Montreal, by the wasting of the
parishes above and below Quebec, by
threatened famine, present desolation, and
the murmurs of his habitants, who were
eager to escape from the army to gather in
their harvests, Montcalm remained upon his
heights, waiting for time and bad weather
to rid the country of the foe.</p>

<p class='caption'>Beauport Churchyard.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>But he had to do with a man whose stock
of endurance matched his own. Disease
weakened the English forces and came near
robbing them of their head; but Wolfe’s
work was not yet done, and on his bed of
pain he still bent every power of mind and
body to the accomplishment of his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Montcalm could not be made to fight
below the town, was it impossible to force
a battle on the plains above Quebec? Impossible
is not a word that heroes love;
much is possible that at the first blush seems
foolhardiness. Wolfe’s rugged pathway to
battle and victory, death and
immortal fame, was there,
waiting his need, and in due
time he discerned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile there had begun
mighty preparation in
fleet and army for some last
attempt on Quebec. There was movement
of ships and bustle of men, re-disposition
of forces, a noisy bombardment of the
Beauport camp—the object of all concealed
even from most of the British officers, lest
some enlightening rumor should reach the
ears of Montcalm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the night of September 12th, Wolfe
made his last reconnaissance, and, haunted,
it may be, by presentiments of his swiftly
approaching death,
repeated to his attendant
officers
some verses of
Gray’s “Elegy in
a Country Churchyard,”
an incident
that has seemed
the more worthy of
note because the
young general’s
own path of glory led so
speedily to the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wolfe well knew the
desperate nature of his plan.
From the opposite shore he
had seen the white tents of
the troops who were on
guard above the Anse-au-Foulon, where he
proposed to land; and he did not know that
the post was commanded by the heedless
coward Vergor, who had only escaped well-merited
disgrace by the interposition
of Bigot and
Vaudreuil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, an hour before sunrise
on the fateful morning
of September 13th, Wolfe
led his forlorn hope to the
spot where the ascent was to
be made, he did not guess
that the guards above slept
at their post; and his heart
was heavy with misgivings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little path had been
rendered impassable by obstructions,
and the men had
to clamber up the face of the
rugged cliff, tree-covered
then as it is to-day,
whilst, below, the
general waited in
agonizing suspense
till a ringing cheer
told him that the
guard was overpowered.
Then the
rough track was
cleared, and, before
day dawned
grey and cloudy
over the fortress,
Wolfe’s little army of four thousand men
(sadly small for the work in hand) had
gained the top of the
cliff, where now lies a
sweet old-fashioned garden
spread to the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Wolfe chose his
battle-ground nearer the
town, on the world-famous
Plains of Abraham.
There he drew up
his men “in the first of
all thin red lines”; there
the French, forced to fight at last, made
their gallant charge; there “fell Wolfe
victorious”; there noble Montcalm received
his mortal wound; and there was sounded
the death-knell of the dominion of France
in North America.
But “the dramatic
ending of the old
order blessed the
birth of the new.”
It has been well
said that “in a
sense, which it is
easier to feel than
to express—two rival races, under two
rival leaders, unconsciously joined hands
on the Plains of Abraham.”</p>

<p class='caption'> Old St. Louis Gate.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Not yet, however, would all the French
admit that their cause was irretrievably
lost. Though Montcalm lay
under the Ursuline Chapel,
in “his soldier’s grave dug
for him, while yet alive,
by the bursting of a shell”;
though Governor de Vaudreuil
had fled and Quebec
had opened her gates to the
foe, the gallant De Lévis
had no thought of acquiescing
in the passing of New France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gathering ten thousand men at Montreal,
he marched in the spring upon Quebec.
The English general,
Murray,
came out, with
a far inferior
force, to meet
him, and again
French and English
locked in
desperate strife
on the plateau behind the city. A tall
shaft, surmounted by a statue of Bellona,
on the Ste. Foy road, marks the battlefield
where the French won their last
victory in a lost
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English
had to retreat
within their
walls, but Murray,
calling even
on the sick and
maimed for such
aid as they could
give, gallantly
defended his
crumbling battlements
till a
fleet from England came to his relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his turn, De Lévis was forced to
retreat, and, though the war smouldered
on for a few months longer, the situation
was hopeless for the French, and just
before the anniversary of Wolfe’s great
victory, their leaders signed the capitulation
of Canada.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/i.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='I'/>N November, 1775,
when the British flag
had waved for sixteen
years over Quebec,
there marched
into the village of
Point Lévis a little
army of gaunt half-starved,
wayworn
men, who for forty
days had been pushing their way through
the hungry wilderness from the settlements
of Maine. On this terrible march the
weaklings of their force had fallen or
turned back, and those who reached the St.
Lawrence (but two-thirds of the original
eleven hundred) had proved their fitness
for hard service by grim, dogged endurance
to the very point of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At their head was a strong, dark-skinned,
black-browed man, full of daring
and energy—Benedict Arnold—ex-druggist,
horse-trader, smuggler, future traitor, but
at that moment, and for several years
to come, one of the ablest and most
inspiring officers in the recently formed
army of the United
Colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and his few

<p class='pindent'>True, times had changed
since Wolfe’s day. That
general’s friend and subordinate,
Sir Guy Carleton,
who proved himself great
alike in war and peace,
was now in command.
But, when Arnold reached the St. Lawrence,
Carleton was absent in Montreal,
whence came rumors of his discomfiture
and capture, and there was but a feeble garrison
of eighteen hundred men to defend the
city. There was now no army encamped
outside the walls to dispute the landing of
the foe; the inhabitants of the country
around were indifferent, if not hostile, to
the English, and Colonel MacLean, Carleton’s
second-in-command, found the situation
disheartening.</p>

city by surprise; but the St. Lawrence
flowed deep and wide between him and his
intended prey, and on the
first rumor of his approach
the English had
taken the precaution of removing
every possible
means of transport out of
the invaders’ reach. Not
a bateau, not a canoe was
to be had, and the eager
Arnold had to send twenty
miles inland for canoes
before he could get within
striking distance of
Quebec.</p>

13th, he embarked

at Point Lévis, and
stole in the darkness across the river to
Wolfe’s Cove. Unopposed, he climbed the
heights, and

drew up his little

with characteristic
audacity,
he marched almost
up to the
St. Louis Gate,
and, with loud
cheers, challenged the enemy to sally forth.
They refused to give him battle, however,
and scorned his summons
to surrender,
so he retreated some
twenty miles up the
river to Point aux
Trembles, there to
await the arrival of
reinforcements under
General Montgomery—an
Irishman of good
family who had held a commission in the
British army before taking up arms for the
seceding Colonies. Entering Canada by way
of Lake Champlain, he had captured the
Forts of St. John’s and Chambly, and had
received the submission of Montreal. Thus
the whole country save Quebec
was at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But General Carleton had
not submitted, and while
Quebec held out for England
he did not despair of saving
the country. On the approach
of the enemy he had
left Montreal, which he
judged indefensible, and had
hastened down the river in a
birch-bark canoe. He had
slipped past some American
vessels under cover of darkness;
and Arnold, before he
left the neighborhood of Quebec,
had the mortification of
hearing the great guns of the
citadel thundering a welcome
to the resolute Governor.
Carleton’s arrival put new heart into the
garrison, and he began instantly to take
measures for a vigorous defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early in December when Montgomery
reached
Point aux Trembles
with clothing,
stores and
a few hundred
ill-disciplined
troops, most of
whom were
counting the days till the term of their
enlistment ended with the close of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joined by a few Canadians,
the little American
army now returned to invest
Quebec. Again the garrison
was summoned to surrender.
Again the demand
was treated with contempt.
In fact Carleton refused
to “hold any parley with rebels”; but the
American leaders hoped soon to humble his
pride. Throwing
up batteries of
ice and snow,
they began to
bombard the
walls; but their
guns were too
light to make any
impression on
the masonry, and
the besieged kept
vigilant guard
against surprise.
On moonless
nights they
lighted the great
ditch surrounding their ramparts by lanterns
hung on poles from the bastions, and
thus not even a dog could
approach unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discouraged by ill-success
and weakened by smallpox,
the American army appeared
to be in danger of
melting away, but the two
leaders resolved to try to
capture Quebec by one bold stroke before
more of the discontented troops left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their plan was
a complicated
one. Montgomery
was to advance
along a
narrow road
skirting the base
of Cape Diamond,
while Arnold, from the suburb of St.
Roch, already in possession of the Americans,
was to enter the Lower Town from the
opposite side, meet Montgomery’s division
at the foot
of Mountain
Street, and
join in an
attempt to
force the barrier
(where
later was
erected the
Prescott
Gate) which
guarded the
approach to
the Upper
Town. Meanwhile,
to distract
the attention
of
the besieged,
a feint was to be made against St. John’s
Gate.</p>

<p class='caption'>General Montgomery.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The time fixed for the attempt was the
early hours of the thirty-first day of December.
The weather was wild and blustering,
promising that the planned surprise would
be complete, and two hours after midnight
Montgomery marched his troops down to
Wolfe’s Cove, and thence along the narrow
drifted path below the cliff, now known as
Champlain Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That they might know each other in
the darkness, his
soldiers wore in
their caps slips of
white paper, on
which they had
written as a watchword,
“Liberty or
death!” Through
the blinding snow
they pressed on
till they reached a barrier of palisades
below the precipitous rock now crowned by
the Citadel. Forcing this, they rushed forward,
with their intrepid leader at their
head, to capture a battery directly in their
path. They had almost reached it, when
the guns suddenly blazed forth a deadly
storm of grapeshot. Montgomery fell
dead, with several of his followers, and
the rest broke and fled precipitately along
the narrow path swept by the cannon,
leaving behind
them their dead
and dying in the
snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arnold, meanwhile,
at the head
of his column,
was pressing towards
the rendezvous,
though when
he passed Palace
Gate he knew that
the attack would
be no surprise, for
bells were ringing
and drums beating the call to arms.
In single file, with bent heads, and guns
covered with their coats, the Americans
dashed forward, stormed the first barrier
at the corner of Sault-au-Matelot Street,
and captured its defenders. But Arnold
was severely wounded in the leg by a
musket-ball, and had to drag himself
back to the General Hospital, whilst his
men made a gallant attempt to seize
the second barrier
also.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this they
failed. Many lost
their lives or
their liberty, and
the remainder fled.
Later in the day
the British sallied
out and set fire
to the suburb of
St. Roch, which
had so long given shelter
to the rebels. Amongst
the buildings consumed
was the Intendant’s Palace,
where Bigot, not
many years earlier, had
dazzled with his shameless
luxury the wretched
people he was defrauding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there was rejoicing in old Quebec;
but Arnold, beaten, wounded, short
of supplies as he was, kept up the blockade
of the city till spring. Then Carleton
received reinforcements from England,
and sallying out of his fortifications swept
the foe before him up the St. Lawrence.
Thus Quebec was saved to the Empire,
and with it was saved the possibility of
the second British “Dominion” in North
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since that time—though the old city
has often rung with the stir of warlike
preparations—though her steep streets have
echoed to the tread of regiments coming
and going—though the Basin has given
anchorage to privateers
and their prizes—though
the wharves have witnessed
the struggles of
many a luckless fisherlad
or townsman in the
clutches of the press-gang—no
hostile army
has ever threatened the
safety of the “Queen
of the North.” Even
during the fierce strife
of the War of
1812, thanks to
the valor of the
descendants of
those who at the
side of Montcalm
so long withstood
Wolfe and his disciplined veterans, the
invading army came no nearer to Quebec
than the field of Chateauguay, where
the valiant De Salaberry and his Voltigeurs
earned the undying gratitude of all lovers
of their country.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/g.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='G'/>LANCING back over
the pages of this
brief sketch, it
might seem that
the memories connected
with Quebec
were all of war.
The names of
many soldier-heroes
glorify the story
of this City of
Five Sieges, and even to-day the ancient
stronghold makes a brave show, like
a mediæval warrior, of being armed
cap-à-pie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first glimpse of Quebec, whether
from the River, Point Lévis, or Beauport,
shows grey bastions and battlements above
all other buildings, and it will be strange
if further knowledge of the place does not
remind you more and more of the warlike
times gone by. The very notices in the shop-windows—bilingual
and giving to the beginner
in the Gallic tongue of our compatriots
a pleasing sense of walking in the pages of
a dictionary—are a reminder of the long
struggle between French
and English for the domination
of this continent.
The driver of your calèche
(if you elect to make your
first tour of the city in
that quaint modern imitation
of a quainter prototype)
will take care
that you miss nothing of
the military flavor of the
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He will tell you the
story of “Notre Dame des

Golden Dog,” that strange memento of a
bitter private quarrel; take you to
handsome Parliament Buildings,
where, in niches in the
façade, you will behold statues of
the warriors Frontenac, Wolfe,
Montcalm, De
Lévis and De
Salaberry, besides
one of that notable
Governor-General,
the Earl
of Elgin, who
risked his popularity by
giving his assent to a
measure for compensating
the sufferers by the
Rebellion of 1837.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close by the Parliament
House is the great
Drill Hall, for the use of
the present-day citizen-soldiers
of Quebec; and
turning back, through
the modern St. Louis
Gate, which has replaced
the portal through which
the wounded Montcalm was swept by a rush
of fugitives into the city to die, one comes
to the site of the surgeon’s office where he
breathed his last.
Not far away there
stood till 1889 another
humble dwelling,
where Montgomery’s
corpse was
prepared for burial.
On the same street
still stands the old Kent House—now a
fascinating curiosity shop—once, towards
the close of the eighteenth century, the
town-residence of Queen Victoria’s father,
then colonel of a regiment of Fusiliers stationed
at Quebec. Some miles distant there
is, by the way, another Kent House, where
the Duke used to spend his summers on
the heights from which the Montmorency
takes its impetuous leap of two hundred
and fifty feet to join the St. Lawrence.
Quebec has also its
Kent Gate, a modern
structure, to commemorate
the same
prince, who, if he
lacked opportunity
to shine as a great
military genius, at
least succeeded in
winning for himself
a reputation as the
strictest of disciplinarians.</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'>Home-woven<br/> Portières.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the military suggestions of Quebec
are not confined to historic associations.
You have them in concrete form, from the
picturesque Citadel—which, however, was
not built till long after the latest siege—to
the little groups of cannon-balls, piled up
in odd corners like a young giant’s marbles.
At any turn you may meet a red-coated
soldier or a blue-jacket from some visiting
iron-clad; you may chance on a long row of
obsolete guns, or
on an ancient
mortar, now
powerless for
mischief, with a
great gag of iron
in its throat;
and here, there
and everywhere
you will find
tablets or monuments
marking
the spots once
deeply stained
with the heart’s
blood of the
brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, after all,
this is but one
aspect of Quebec,
and not the
brightest. To
some persons the
fair old town
speaks more insistently of peace than of
war; for so quaint is it, so old-world, that
it seems, despite all evidence to the contrary,
that here life must have run on
undisturbed for centuries. To one brought
up in another community, the unfamiliar
figures of quaintly-garbed nuns, long-robed
priests, and brothers in russet gowns, suggest
the long-ago. The very markets, with
all their bustle and hurry of eager life,
seem survivals of the past.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A charm and a glamor hangs over the
generally commonplace business of buying
and selling, getting gain and making provision
for the humble needs of the day. The
whole thing seems like a picture-book. The
groups of voluble, good-humored habitant
women; the queer little carts like ladders
mounted on wheels; the small pink pigs,
squealing their hardest as they are transferred
from the crates of the vendors to the
sacks of the purchasers; the background of
tall, irregular buildings climbing the great
cliff—these lend to the scene a color and
character all its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wandering from stall to stall, heaped
with vegetables, home-grown tobacco, dark
slabs of maple sugar, home-woven towelling
curtains or carpets, firmly knit socks, elaborately
plaited
mats, you begin to
wonder at the
patience and industry
of this
vivacious people,
and you will wonder
at these qualities
still more if
you see the habitant
at home.</p>

<p class='caption'>A Shrine in a garden.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go down, for instance,
to Beaupré
or St. Joachim,
those parishes
which Wolfe once
so mercilessly harried.
It is a fair and fruitful land, well-watered
by the “full-fed river,” and over it
now seems to brood the gentle angel of
peace. Amongst the low curved roofs of
the villages rise the towers of great
churches, like that at Beauport and the
miraculous St. Anne, whither every year
come pilgrims in thousands seeking health
or peace of mind. Behind
these villages, if you
step but a little aside from
the splendid waterway of
the St. Lawrence, you may
lose yourself on sparsely-tracked,
forest-covered
hills, cleft with gullies,
down which foam torrents,
choked at times with thousands
of grinding logs.
But, after all, it is
only a hermit who
would long bury
himself amongst
these hills.</p>

below lead past barns
with thatched roofs,
log cow-houses with
overhanging upper-storeys,
cottages
with projecting
“galleries”
and windows
shaded
with wall-paper,
rugged stone
houses with huge chimneys,
“bake-ovens” under
rude shelters of planks,
drinking-troughs, wayside
crosses, and flowery
gardens, containing little
shrines, within which
glimmer tiny white images
of the Virgin and her Son.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Along these roads comes
the oddest assortment of
vehicles ever seen, I should think, in one
district of the Dominion. The habitant
carries home his hay in a two-wheeled cart,
fitted with a rack and drawn by a rough
pony or a yoke of deliberate oxen; and he
rides to church or market in a springless
conveyance, which is a kind of grotesque
compromise between a “top-buggy” and a
“buckboard.” When coming from work,
however, he contents
himself
with a humbler
vehicle, rattling
down the stony
slopes at a surprising
pace in a
little cart drawn
by a lean, rough-coated, stout-limbed
dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little farther along the
same road you may see a stray
automobile, while on the other
side of the fence run the electric
cars of the Quebec Railway
Light &amp; Power Company,
or occasionally, on the same
line, a train of “steam-cars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the country near Quebec
is well supplied now with
railroads, and the townsfolk
are learning to follow the modern fashion
of living in country cottages during the
summer months. Quebec merchants leave
the city by the evening trains to spend their
leisure hours with their families at Charlesbourg,
Lorette, Montmorency, or some
equally interesting but till lately inaccessible
place. Others take the small modern
steamboats which ply up and down the
shores of the St. Lawrence, or to and
from the beautiful Island of Orleans,
and which have to make their way carefully
past great rafts of lumber, fleet
“ocean greyhounds,” or quaint barges of
the same pattern as those used by Wolfe
in his attack upon Quebec.
These newcomers into the
country bring new fashions,
which in course of time will
have their effect upon the
habitants; but their influence
is as yet scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women in broad-brimmed
straw hats are still seen in
the hay-fields at work beside
the men, yet they find
time for much labor at
loom and spinning-wheel,
besides keeping
well scrubbed and
scoured the old floors
and simple furniture,
which have rendered
good service to their
mothers and grandmothers before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ask the age of some cottage heirloom—some
gaunt old clock or cumbrous chair—and
its owner with a smile and a shrug will
assure you, vaguely, “It’s ancient, very
ancient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You do not doubt the assertion; you only
wonder how this corner of the restless
New World came to have such persistent,
all-pervading regard for the past. So many
things are “very ancient” in Quebec; yet
it is full of its own characteristic life, this
once-French city, which has been British
for half its three hundred years of history.</p>
